                    We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental 
                    consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.<br/><br/>
                    If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country 
                    requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that 
                    information.<br/><br/>
